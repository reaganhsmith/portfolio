            <p>I really enjoyed creating this website. I was given restraints on what the website needed to have on it and what sources I could draw from. I was asked to include weather from a weather API and have the option for the user to create a smoothie. The options for the smoothie and nutritional information comes from a JS array. This website taught me how to use Javascript within a website.</p>

            <p>This website was for my webfrontend class at BYU-I. I was asked to choose a city and re-do the website for it. I also was given an outline for the web page that I was asked to recreate using CSS, HTML and Javascript. This project taught me more about how to utilize Javascript for your websites. </p>

            <h4>Summer 2023</h4>
            <p> This website was for a Web Backend Development class. We used MVC to create a car website that drew from a database to get information on the different vehicles the dealership has available. I was nervous about learning backend development but I found it to be very fun and loved the problem solving aspect to it. I also loved working with SQL and MVC. </p>

            <p>This was one of the very first web pages I created with HTML and CSS. It was part of what sparked my interest in web development. I had a fun time creating this website and using css makes it fabulous. This site taught me more about the power of grids and layouts to make a website. </p>

            <p>Something I am very passionate about as a person is the ocean and marine life. For this website I was asked to pick or create a nonprofit and create a website for it. I picked taking care of our ocean because it is something I am very passionate about. I enjoyed picking the color pallet for this site as well and designing the layout and logo. </p>

            <h3>JS Madlib</h3>
            <h4>Spring 2023</h4>
            <p> I do not come from a coding background but recently picked it up a few years ago in school. I had no experience with JavaScript and I am still learning. In one of my classes for my final project I created a fun JS madlib for the user to play or participate in. This project pushed me out of my comfort zone and made me fall in love with JS.</p>

            <h4>Fall 2022</h4>
            <p>This was for an Advanced CSS class where we were asked to take what we had learned and apply it to the CSS zen Garden. The theme I went with was circus because I thought it would be fun and different. I tried to create a fun website using css grid, border-radius and animations. This project was a great reminder of the variety of things CSS can do to alter a website. </p>

          <p>&#9758; Most of my experience to this point is what I have showcased above and done in my classes. I have loved the classes I have taken because they have taught me different aspects of web design and development. Through this I have been able to figure out what I like most. I have learned I like web development the most and specifically working with CSS, HTML and JS. I also learned that backend development is very fun and I like working with SQL. </p>
          <p>&#9758; I am currently a teacher's assistant for Web Front End Development I at Brigham Young University Idaho. My job involves grading students' code and assignments. I also help the students work through problems with css, html, javascript and github. </p>
          <p>&#9758; Another thing I have done is work with Triguard Pest Control. I have helped do a lot of different designs for them. I have created a variety of fliers, t-shirts, banners, social media posts, and helped with their marketing website. I have worked with them for around 2 years now and would consider myself their one call graphic designer.  </p>
